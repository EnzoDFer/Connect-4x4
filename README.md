This is my go at an interactive browser-based game written with ts.

I struggled initially with creating the 3dimensional board game 
with individual responsive pieces.  In the end, I was able to learn a
lot by seeing how user h20x (https://codepen.io/h20x/pen/YQYrOa) was
able to create a 3-dimensional rubiks cube which mimicked the type of
structure I was going for.
